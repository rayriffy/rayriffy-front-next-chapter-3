    I am a full-stack web developer, who keeps looking for new challenges. Over
    the past 8 years, I have been learning web technologies since junior high
    school as a hobby. I am also always energetic to learn about upcoming modern
    web technologies and try to put them into practical use.

  <h1>
    More than that I am a maker, automating workflows both in my daily life to
    the workplace to simplify much manual work, and keep life less busy. I also
    sometimes created IoT hardware to build many interesting things from smart
    home devices to the embedded system.
